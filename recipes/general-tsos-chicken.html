    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      General Tso's Chicken is a very popular option that you'll see at almost
      all of your campus's local Chinese restaurants. It is a great combination
      of sweet and tangy, and will add lots of flavor to your boring ol' chicken
      breast. Have it alongside white rice or chow mein, as well as steamed
      vegetables of your choice.
