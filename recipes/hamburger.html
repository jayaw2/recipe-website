    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The American cuisine staple: the burger. Several of the dining options on
      your campus likely offer burgers on their menu. However, if you follow
      this simple but effective recipe, you will have the skills to create your
      own less expensive but tastier burger patties with minimal effort. This is
      a perfect meal to share with friends without having to use a grill.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 pack of ground beef (preferably close to 80% lean for best taste)
      </li>
      <li>Buns of choice (brioche is my personal favorite)</li>
      <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
      <li>Garlic Powder</li>
      <li>Onion Powder</li>
      <li>
        Toppings of choice: lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, cheese, giardinera
        (personal favorite), etc.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Take a handful of ground beef and place on chopping board.</li>
      <li>
        Heavily season beef with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll seasoned beef into a large ball with your hands and then flatten
        with palms. Leave about an inch of thickness for the patty
      </li>
      <li>
        Indent the middle of one side of patty with the thumb to check for
        cookedness. Leave about a 2-cm indentation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set frying pan on stove on medium-high heat and place two patties on
        pan. No olive oil needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook one side of patty for 3-4 minutes on medium-high without touching
        the patty.
      </li>
      <li>
        After one side is cooked, flip the patties and do not touch for another
        3 minutes. If desired, place a slice of cheese on the cooked side of
        each patty.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once both sides are cooked, take off pan and place in plate. If desired
        toast buns in a toaster and apply topiings, condiments, and sauces of
        your choice. My personal favorites are cheddar and giardinera on a
        brioche bun.
      </li>
    </ol>
